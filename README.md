# myProjects
My final project for The Tech Academy Bootcamp HTML/CSS course!
I've created a website about my adventures in the video game valheim and a site about a few amazing trees around portland,
I've also created a hilarious page aobut my dog that nobody but me will ever see!
Anyway, this is my portfolio site and I look forward to adding many new projects over the next few months!
